Aimbotics static site (beginner friendly)
========================================

Folder structure
----------------
aimbotics-site/
  index.html            -> Home with hero + overview
  services.html         -> Detailed services (electrical, energy, HVAC, solar, instrumentation, docs)
  contact.html          -> Simple contact form (no backend yet)
  assets/
    css/style.css       -> Styles
    js/main.js          -> Small JS (form + mobile menu)
    img/                -> Images (placeholders were copied from your uploads)

How to use
----------
1) Download the ZIP and extract it.
2) Double click `index.html` to view locally, or upload the whole folder to any static host
   (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, or your cPanel hosting).
3) To make the contact form actually send an email, connect a backend or a service like
   Formspree, Basin, or Netlify Forms (replace the JS accordingly).

Branding
--------
- Update the logo text and favicon in `assets/img/favicon.svg` (create one if needed).
- Replace images in `assets/img` with your own site photos, project pictures, and icons.
